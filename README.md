# StudManager

This project is a comprehensive Student Management System designed to streamline the process of managing student records, courses, and academic data within an educational institution. It leverages the robustness of Spring Boot in the backend for secure and efficient data handling, coupled with a dynamic and user-friendly interface powered by React in the frontend.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. The project consists of two main parts: the backend server built with Spring Boot and the frontend UI built with React.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- JDK 17 or later for the Spring Boot backend
- Node.js and npm for the React frontend
- An IDE of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

#### Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:

```sh
cd backend
```

Run the Spring Boot application:

```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The backend server should start and be accessible on `http://localhost:8080`.

#### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```sh
cd ../frontend
```

Install the necessary npm packages:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the React development server:

```sh
npm start
```

The frontend should now be accessible on `http://localhost:3000`.
